# 🐘 PHP Reference Guide  
**By Timmy 🚀**

Welcome to the **PHP Reference Guide**, a beginner-friendly, code-first collection of core PHP concepts. This project mirrors a JavaScript reference format, and is meant for quick lookups and simple learning.

## 📌 What’s Inside

This guide includes:

- ✅ Variables and conditionals  
- 🔁 Loops (for, while)  
- 💡 Functions (with/without parameters, return values)  
- 🔧 Arrays and associative arrays  
- 🛠 Objects and classes (OOP basics)  
- ⚠️ Error handling (try-catch, custom exceptions)  
- 🎯 String interpolation  
- ➡️ Arrow functions (PHP 7.4+)

## 📂 How to Use

You can:

- Copy snippets directly into your local `.php` files.
- Run them in a PHP interpreter or browser (if using a server like XAMPP ).
- Use as a study or teaching resource.

> 💡 Each snippet is self-contained and runnable.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher (for arrow functions)  
- Basic understanding of PHP syntax

## 📌 Inspiration

This guide is a follow-up to my **JavaScript Reference Guide**, created in the same format. The idea is to build language guides that are fun, readable, and useful for learners and quick references.
